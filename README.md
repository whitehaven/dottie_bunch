"I'm .dottie Bunch. I'm the king-maker." -Frisky Dingo. 

My dotfiles. My idea right now is to back up only ones that I'm getting used to; a lot of the tools I use I'm not sure about.

I'm considering splitting up my `.bash_profile` also, but if I were to go through doing that, it better not get lost, so there's that as well. (If I do in fact do that, I suppose.)
