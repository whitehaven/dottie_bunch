# vim-anyfold

Generic folding mechanism and motion based on indentation. Fold anything that is structured into indented blocks. Quickly navigate between blocks.


## Introduction

This Vim plugin comes with the following features:
* Folding mechanism based on indented blocks that has a very intuitive and predictable behaviour (see examples below).
* Results comparable to syntax aware folding methods but fast and generic algorithm that does not rely on language specific rules.
* Works out of the box for any filetypes, optimal results for all indented languages (including properly indented curly brace languages).
* Shortcuts to navigate to beginning / end of a block and to previous / next indented block.
* Can handle corner cases with ease (comments, varying indentation widths, line breaks).
* Fast update mechanism that keeps folds in sync with buffer.

It has the following shortcomings:
* Can **not** correctly fold mismatched indentation and thus should only be used together with disciplined programming style (or in combination with Vim's `equalprg` autoindent feature).

### Java
Note: this example is outdated since better defaults have been implemented for curly braces.

Examples were recorded using

```vim
let anyfold_activate=1
let anyfold_fold_comments=1
set foldlevel=0
colorscheme solarized
hi Folded term=NONE cterm=NONE
```


## Setup and usage

1. Install this plugin with a vim plugin manager.
2. Add the following lines to your vimrc (if not already present).

    ```vim
    filetype plugin indent on
    syntax on
    let anyfold_activate=1
    set foldlevel=0
    ```

    Choose a higher foldlevel if you prefer to have folds open by default.
3. Use Vim's fold commands `zo`, `zO`, `zc`, `za`, ... to fold / unfold folds (read `:h fold-commands` for more information). Use key combinations `[[` and `]]` to navigate to the beginning and end of the current open fold. Use `]k` and `[j` to navigate to the end of the previous block and to the beginning of the next block.


## Additional remarks

1. *Filetype specific activation:*
    Activate anyfold for a selected \<filetype\> only with

    ```vim
    autocmd Filetype <filetype> let b:anyfold_activate=1
    ```
2. *Supported folding commands:* anyfold uses `foldmethod=expr` to define folds. Thus all commands that work with expression folding are supported.
3. *Fold display:* anyfold's minimalistic display of closed fold assumes that folds are highlighted by your color scheme. If that is not the case, consider installing a suitable color scheme or highlight folds yourself by a command similar to

    ```vim
    hi Folded term=underline
    ```

4. *Customization:* For expert configuration, anyfold triggers an event `anyfoldLoaded` after initialisation. This enables user-defined startup steps such as

    ```vim
    autocmd User anyfoldLoaded normal zv
    ```

   which unfolds the line in which the cursor is located when opening a file.
5. *Documentation:* For more detailed instructions and information, read the included vim doc `:h anyfold`.


## Options

All options can be either set globally

```vim
let <option>=<value>
```

or filetype specific

```vim
autocmd Filetype <filetype> let <option>=<value>
```

Option | Values | Default value |  Description
------ | -------------- | ------------- | ------------
`anyfold_fold_display` | 0, 1 | 1 | Minimalistic display of closed folds
`anyfold_motion` | 0, 1 | 1 | Map motion commands to `[[`, `]]`, `[j`, `]k`
`anyfold_identify_comments` | 0, 1 | 1 | Identify (and ignore) comment lines
`anyfold_fold_comments` | 0, 1 | 0 | Fold multiline comments
`anyfold_fold_toplevel` | 0, 1 | 0 | Fold subsequent unindented lines


## Complementary plugins

Here is a small list of plugins that I find very useful in combination with vim-anyfold:
* Cycle folds with one key, much more efficient than Vim's built-in folding commands: [vim-fold-cycle](https://github.com/arecarn/vim-fold-cycle)
* Indent based text objects are not (yet) implemented in vim-anyfold, but this plugin works fine (even though blocks are defined in a slightly different way): [vim-indent-object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object)
