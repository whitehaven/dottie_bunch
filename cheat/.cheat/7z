7z
A file archiver with highest compression ratio

Args:
a       add
d       delete
e       extract
l       list
t       test
u       update
x       extract with full paths

Example:
7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z dir1

-t7z        7z archive
-m0=lzma    lzma method
-mx=9       level of compression = 9 (ultra)
-mfb=64     number of fast bytes for lzma = 64
-md=32m     dictionary size = 32 Mb
-ms=on      solid archive = on

-m0=?
	lzma	- Efficient compression
			* (+)	May achieve marginal compression gains compared to lzma2
			* (--)	Single-core operation only
	lzma2	- Optimized, multicore lzma
			* (+++)	multicore optimization means much higher performance
			* (-)	marginal-to-none loss of compression vs. lzma
	ppmd	- Prediction by Partial Matching
			* (+++) *.txt, *.csv (where much of file is text)
			* (-) 	*.docx - formatting data is not (as) amenable to ppmd
			* (-) 	binary files - no textual structure
	bzip2	- Standard FOSS compression
			* (++)	decent for text-based files
			* (+)	compatible with any UNIX OS, and FOSS software
	Deflate	- Standard ZIP and gzip compression
			* (++) 	compatible anywhere, including naive Windows
			* (+) 	reasonable performance
			* (---) very weak compression
			* (+)	has option Deflate64 to use 64k dict, some benefit

ARCHIVE WITH MAXIMUM COMPRESSION
7z a -t7z -mx9 folder1.7z folder1

ARCHIVE WITH MAXIMUM COMPRESSION WITH PASSWORD
7z a -p -t7z -mx9 folder1.7z folder1

# p: 7z will prompt for password

ARCHIVE WITH NO COMPRESSION
7z a t7z -mx0 folder1.7z folder1

ARCHIVE WITH NO COMPRESSION WITH PASSWORD
7z a -p -t7z -mx0 folder1.7z folder1

EXTRACT files from archive
7z x stuff.7z

	Extract to a place:
	7z x stuff.7x -o{location}
		e.g.,
		7z x stuff.7z -o/mnt/disk
	
Extract files in ravelled form (ignore directory structure):
7z e stuff.7z

COMPRESSION SWITCHS
-mx0 Don't compress at all. Is called "copy mode."
-mx1 Very low compression. It is called "fastest" mode.
-mx3 Fast compression mode. Will set various parameters automatically.
-mx5 Same as above, but "normal."
-mx7 "maximum" compression.
-mx9 "ultra" compression. You probably want to use this.
